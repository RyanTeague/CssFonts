/*The CSS font-family property
In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

Note: if the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation
marks, like: "Times New Roman".

Tip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a
"fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between
browsers/operaring systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a 
generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if
no other fonts are avilable). The font names should be separated with a
comma.

Example
Specify some different fonts for three praragraphs:

.p1 {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  }
  
  .p2 {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  }
  
  .p3 {
    font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
  }
