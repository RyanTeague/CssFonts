    <!--Font Selection is Important
    
        Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a 
        website.

        The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

        Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your
        text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the
        fort.

    <!--Generic Font Families
    
        In CSS there are five generic font fammilies:

        1. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create 
        a sense of formality and elegance.

        2. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They 
        create a modern and minimalistic look.

        3. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width.
        They create a mechanical look.
        
        4. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.

        5. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

        All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.

        Note: On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read
        than serif fonts.
